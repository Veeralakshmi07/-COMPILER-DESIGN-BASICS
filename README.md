The program is a simple lexical analyzer implemented in C, designed to read an input source code file and identify its basic lexical components, specifically keywords, operators, and identifiers. Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler where the source code is broken down into meaningful tokens that are easier for the subsequent stages of the compiler to process. In this program, the input file named "input.txt" is opened for reading using the standard C file handling function fopen. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, the program prints an error message and exits. The program defines an array of strings containing all the keywords in the C language, including data types, control structures, and storage classes. The function isKeyword takes a string as input and iterates over the array of keywords, comparing each element with the input string using the strcmp function. If a match is found, the function returns 1 indicating that the string is a keyword; otherwise, it returns 0, indicating it is not a keyword. The program also defines a function isOperator that takes a single character as input and checks if it matches any of the common C operators such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators. If a match is found, it returns 1, indicating the character is an operator, otherwise it returns 0. In the main function, the program reads the input file character by character using fgetc. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are skipped to focus only on meaningful characters. If the character is an operator, it is printed directly along with a label indicating that it is an operator. If the character is an alphabet letter, it indicates the start of a word that could be either a keyword or an identifier. A local array str is used to collect all consecutive alphanumeric characters and underscores, forming the complete word. The index variable i is used to track the position in this array and is reset to zero each time a new word starts. Each character of the word is added to the array, and the null character \0 is appended at the end to mark the termination of the string in C. Once a complete word is formed, the program calls isKeyword to determine whether it is a C keyword or a user-defined identifier. The result is then printed to the console in the format of the word followed by either “Keyword” or “Identifier”. This process continues until the end of the file is reached. After processing all characters and words, the file is closed using fclose, ensuring that resources are properly released. The output demonstrates the basic lexical analysis of the source code in the input file, showing the separation of operators, keywords, and identifiers. This program provides a foundational understanding of compiler design, specifically the lexical analysis phase, and can be extended further to include numbers, string literals, punctuation, and comments. The program is modular and simple, clearly showing how to process a source code file, identify different types of tokens, and print the results in a readable format. Sample input such as a line of code including variable declarations and operators will result in output that categorizes each component appropriately, making this a useful demonstration of the core concepts of lexical analysis and the first step in compiler construction.
